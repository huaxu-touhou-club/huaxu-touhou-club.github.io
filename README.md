## Contributing

To contribute, you need to install

- git
- npm
- hexo
- [hexo-deployer-git](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git)

The source file for all posts are in the `source` branch.

After you make edits, please rebuild the site with the following command:

```bash
hexo clean
hexo d -g
```

to deploy to github.

After verifying that the deployment is successful, push your changes to the `source` branch.


### But I don't understand all these...

Just remind me after you open a PR and I'll deploy it for you.
